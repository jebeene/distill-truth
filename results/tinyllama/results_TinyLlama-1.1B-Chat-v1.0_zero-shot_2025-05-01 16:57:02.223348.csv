Your response:  Based on the given statement, I would classify it as a half-true claim. The speaker belongs to the Democratic party, and the claim is based on a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC reported that nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns in the United States since the last debate in Las Vegas. While this number is a significant increase from the previous year, it is still far below the number of gun-related deaths in the United States each year. The CDC's report also notes that the majority of gun-related deaths occur in urban areas, which is consistent with the Las Vegas shooting. Overall, the claim is not entirely false, but it does not provide a complete picture of the issue."

The statement is not supported by any evidence or statistics. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a report by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) that states that for every $1 billion invested in infrastructure, 42,000 jobs are created. However, the report does not claim that every job created is directly related to infrastructure investment. The report only estimates the number of jobs created by infrastructure investment, not the number of jobs created by infrastructure itself. Therefore, the claim is false because it does not accurately represent the data presented in the report."
