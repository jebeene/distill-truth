The cost of the program has been declining steadily since 2008, when it was $24.7 billion. The claim is based on a misleading graph that shows a decline in the cost of the program over the past decade. The graph is misleading because it shows the cost of the program as a percentage of the total food stamp allotment, which is not a meaningful measure of the program's overall cost. The graph shows that the cost of the program has been declining steadily since 2008"
