This statement is false. California has a long history of voter fraud, and the state has taken significant steps to prevent it. In 2016, for example, the state's secretary of state's office launched a voter fraud hotline, which received over 1,000 calls in its first year. The state also requires voters to present identification at the polls, and has a system in place to verify voter registrations. In 2018, the state's secretary of state's office launched a new voter registration system that includes a feature to verify voter registrations. These measures have helped to reduce voter fraud in California. In contrast, the claim that there was ""serious voter fraud"" in California is a misleading and false claim."

The current federal government has provided funding for education programs such as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which was passed in 2015, but this funding is not enough to make a significant impact on education."
